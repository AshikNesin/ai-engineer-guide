[Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) team has released **minimal open source** version of  [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/)  using which you can use to build React App.

👉 [https://github.com/mendableai/open-lovable](https://github.com/mendableai/open-lovable)

Under the hood it uses firecrawl for web scraping (obviously!) and [E2B](https://e2b.dev) for running custom code code in a safe, sandbox environment.

And as for AI inference they currently support: Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini/Groq

The app feels little flaky but I guess it'll get improved over the period of time.
