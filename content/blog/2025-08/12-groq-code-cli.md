CLI Agents are the talk of the town. Everyone is building and releasing one ðŸ˜…

Recently, Groq has released their own CLI coding agent.

The approach that they took is they've old built the bare essentials that are needed for CLI coding agents **intentionally**

Their goal is to help people to build their own custom coding agent that solves their use case.

ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/build-with-groq/groq-code-cli

## How to get started?

```shell
# Clone their repo
git clone https://github.com/build-with-groq/groq-code-cli
npm install
npm run build
npm link # link "groq" command to this project
```

Once you link it, you should be able to run `groq` command now.

And you can login with `/login` command in the CLI.

Happy building CLI-agent!
