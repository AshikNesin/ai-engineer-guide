Claude Code team has recently shipped [customizable status lines](https://x.com/_catwu/status/1953927012592366062) feature.

We can combine this with [ccusage](/blog/claude-code-usage/) and we have a a beautiful CLI like this ðŸ‘‡

## Getting Started
Make sure you're on latest version of claude code. If not update it by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Add this in your `Â ~/.claude/settings.json` file

```json
{
"statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "npx -y ccusage statusline"
  }
}
```

That's pretty much it.

Honestly, Anthropic should have provided this as a first class feature. Maybe they're not doing so for business reasons ðŸ¤‘
