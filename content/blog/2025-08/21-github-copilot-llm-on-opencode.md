Today I learned that you can use **GitHub Copilot** models on [OpenCode](https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/opencode/)

This means if you already have a GitHub Copilot subscription, you can just use it with OpenCode and don't have to worry about paying the vendor directly.

## How to setup?
Just run OpenCode and select GitHub Copilot. 

Then log in with your GitHub account and give permission.

```
opencode auth login
```
