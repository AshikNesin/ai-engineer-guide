OpenAI has released much hyped [gpt-5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/)

From the looks of it, it is going to be a really good model especially for coding tasks.

Here are some of the notes related to it.

They've released three variant:

| Variant    | Best for                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| gpt-5      | Complex reasoning, broad world knowledge, and code-heavy or multi-step agentic tasks |
| gpt-5-mini | Cost-optimized reasoning and chat; balances speed, cost, and capability              |
| gpt-5-nano | High-throughput tasks, especially simple instruction-following or classification     |

There is a really good article in Latent Space which covers more about it.
