Google has released a TINY model that embodies the **right tool for the job** philosophy. 

It's a 270M (yeah, million not billion ðŸ˜…)

It has support for full model **fine tune** support. For example, you can fine tune it using [Transformers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_full_finetune)

And it is primarily intent for on-device LLM use cases.

Here is a quick demo of Bedtime story generator  that runs entirely on your browser using Â Transformers.jsðŸ‘‡

## How to use it using Ollama?
