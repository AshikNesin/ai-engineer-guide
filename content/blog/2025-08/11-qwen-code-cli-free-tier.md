[Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) is a agentic/coding CLI. It is a fork on Gemini CLI with[ Qwen Coder LLM](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder) model.

Currently they provide generous free tier if you login with Qwen OAuth (qwen.ai account) 👇
- **2,000 requests per day** with no token limits 🌟
- 60 requests per minute rate limit

Well, it may not be as good as Claude Code but for things that might NOT require powerful model or where you don't want to spend money, this might be a good choice.


## Getting Started

```shell
npx @​qwen-code/qwen-code@latest
```

## Disclaimer
As with anything, since we're getting this service for free. They might be training on our data like Gemini CLI.

And also, their model may fallback to maintain service quality.
