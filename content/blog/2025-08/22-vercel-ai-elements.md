## How to get started?

### Prerequisites
- `shadcn/ui` initialized in your project
- Tailwind CSS configured (AI Elements supports CSS Variables mode only)

### Installation
```shell
# Use directly (recommended)
npx ai-elements@latest
```
It'll setup `shadcn/ui` if not done already.

Similar to shadcn ui components, these components are also installed in your components directory.

If you want to install the components separately, you can do so by running the following command

```shell
npx ai-elements@latest add <component-name>
```
