Recently I came to know that you get $5 credit every month for Perplexity AI models if you're on Perplexity Pro plan.

## How to get started?
Head over to your [Perplexity setting page](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/group) and add your billing details if not done already.

And then you'll be asked to give your credit card. You can give it. They don't charge you if you spend less than $5/mo

Once you're done, head over to [API key](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/keys) and get your API key.

We'll be using this key to make LLM calls going forward.

## Making LLM Call.
It is as simple as making OpenAI api calls. In fact, their API follows chat completion and you can drop in replace it with your OpenAI API just by changing the base API URL.

Here is an example

```js
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "What's the current repo rate in India?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```
You'll be getting a response like this

If you notice, the response you get is **real time** response not some pretrained knowlerge. That is the core offering of Sonar models.

## Sonar Models
Perplexity has wide range of LLM models available that you might find it useful depending on the use case.
