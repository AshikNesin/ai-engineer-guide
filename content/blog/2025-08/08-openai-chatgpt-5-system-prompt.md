I've recently came across ChatGPT 5 system prompt in X by [Pliny the Liberator ](https://x.com/elder_plinius)

Like always this could be a potential hallucination but there is a high chance this could be real since elder-plinius has released lot of [prompt leaks](https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S) in the past that are real. And it is a good learning for us to see how the AI company is prompting for their products

Here is the prompt 👉 https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/blob/main/OPENAI/ChatGPT5-08-07-2025.mkd

Just in case, here is the copy of the prompt from that are used in ChatGPT 5.
