[Mastra.ai](https://mastra.ai) is a Typescript based agent framework which has lot of features that you need to build an AI app with better DX.

One of the feature that they've started supporting is model fallback.

Here is an example of it.

```ts
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core';
import { openai, anthropic } from '@mastra/llm';

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'weather-assistant',
  instructions: 'You are a weather assistant.',
  model: [
    {
      model: openai('gpt-5-mini'),
      maxRetries: 5,
    },
    {
      model: anthropic('claude-4-5-sonnet'),
      maxRetries: 1,
    },
  ],
});

```
