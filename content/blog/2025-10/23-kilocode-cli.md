Kilocode team has recently released agentic [CLI](https://kilocode.ai/docs/cli), it is more of like Claude Code which you can use in the terminal to do some task.

## How to get started?
We can install it from npm

```shell
npm install -g @kilocode/cli
```

And start run `kilocode` to start the AI Agent.

Overall, this feels like a very early stage and might not be useful at the moment. I find it little slow when compared with other tools like Claude Code, Drod, etc.

For example, I was not able to make it run with GLM Coding Plan.

Anyway, here is the official video by them.

You can find the source code of this CLI ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/tree/main/cli which is a good learning material on how a agentic CLI is being built.
