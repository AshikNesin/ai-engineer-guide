Claude Code now has support for plugins using which you can easily share **Slash commands, Subagents, Hooks, MCP Servers**

## Why?
> Moving forward, plugins will be our standard way to bundle and share Claude Code customizations, and weâ€™ll continue to evolve the format as we add more extension points

Instead of manually sharing things, Claude Code team wants us to leverage the plugins to share it.

## How to get started?
Make sure you're on latest version of Claude Code (if not `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)

Then enter `/plugins`

It'll give you options to manage the plugins like installing/uninstalling plugins & marketplace. You can think of marketplace as a store in which you can install specific plugins.
