[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is a open started for setting context for AI agents (think of README for the AI agents)

A typical AGENTS.md file will be something like this ðŸ‘‡

And it has first class support in almost all popular AI IDEs/coding agents like Cursor, Zed, GitHub Copilot, etc

## How to reference it in Claude Code?
Although it is not supported by default in Claude Code. 

We can still add refer it in `CLAUDE.md` to guide Claude Code to refer to our AGENTS.md like this.

```md
@AGENTS.md
```
By doing so we maintain a single source of truth - `AGENTS.md`

Happy adding LLM-context!
