With the API key, you can now launch the agent

  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_CURSOR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{

    "text": "Your prompt to implement X feature ðŸŒŸ"
  },
  "source": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/your-name/your-repo",
    "ref": "main"
  }
}'
```

  "prompt": {
    "text": "Fix this UI issue in the login issue",
    "images": [
      {
