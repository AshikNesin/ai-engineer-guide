Andrej Karpathy has recently released [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) where he builds a ChatGPT like LLM from scratch purely for the purpose of learning.

This project is roughly 8000 lines of code [hand-written](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1977758204139331904) by him.

And it covers:
- Building a tokenizer (rust)
- Pretraining a Transformer LLM on [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1)
- Midtrain on user-assistant conversations from SmolTalk, tool use, etc
- Efficient inference the model in an Engine with KV cache
- Simple prefill/decode
- Tool use (Python interpreter in a lightweight sandbox)
- Talk to it over CLI or ChatGPT-like WebUI.

And much more.

And the best part is, for **~$100** in cost (~4 hours on an 8XH100 node) you should be able to replicate it ðŸ¤¯
