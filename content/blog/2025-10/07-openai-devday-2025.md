  - It uses Responses API under the hood
  - You can think of Agent Builder as a toned down version of n8n clone ðŸ˜…
  - ChatKit helps to build chat apps. (Not sure if they'll support other models providers though)
- **Apps in ChatGPT** - They've partner with apps like Canva, Booking, Coursera, etc to show the apps within the ChatGPT chat UI itself. For example, you can watch a course in Coursera and parallelly ask some questions regarding what you're trying to learn.
