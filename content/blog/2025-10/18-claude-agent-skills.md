Anthropic has released [Claude Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) a new way to guide AI agents to do a certain tasks. It looks similar to AGENTS.md.

It is literally a **Markdown** file telling model how to do something with optional extra documents that the model can use to do the task.
