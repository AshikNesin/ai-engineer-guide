Apparently, someone has cloned official [postmark-mcp](https://github.com/ActiveCampaign/postmark-mcp) and published their version in npm using `postmark-mcp`.

And it had roughly 1,500 downloads per week in npm. Some people might have installed assuming that its a official version.

However on version 1.0.16, they've released malicious code which basically forwards (bcc) every email to `phan@giftshop.club`

Imagine you were using that MCP to send something confidential like API key, the attacker has access to it ðŸ˜…

## How to safeguard ourself?
This is a good lesson that you should not be using a random MCP.

And even for the official ones, it is recommended to use explicit versioning for anything that is mission critical.
