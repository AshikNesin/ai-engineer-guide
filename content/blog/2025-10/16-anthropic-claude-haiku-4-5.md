Anthropic has released Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) their latest **small model** which is good for **low-latency tasks** where you need speed/cost more than being accurate.

In terms of benchmark it is as good as Claude Sonnet 4.

Based on the benchmark, it looks like good for **agentic use case** where this model is used as sub-agent in combination with an orchestrator model like Sonnet 4.5.

And here is the comparison between other models

The pricing is more than old Haiku (but I guess they increased it because of intelligence?)

| Token Type | Price per million |
|------------|-------------------|
| Input      | $1                |
| Output     | $5                |

Sam Witteveen has a high level walk through of this model in his recent video ðŸ‘‡
