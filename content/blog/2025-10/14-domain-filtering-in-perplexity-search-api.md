Perplexity Search API now has support for domain filtering using which we can get content only from a **specific domain**.

All we need to do use pass the domains in `search_domain_filter` parameter (max 20 domains).

## Example Snippet
```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.perplexity.ai/search' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "prompt engineering",
    "search_domain_filter": [
      "aiengineerguide.com"
    ],
    "max_results": 1
  }' | jq
```
And we'll be getting the response like this:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Prompt Engineering 101 by Anthropic - AI Engineer Guide",
      "url": "https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/prompt-engineering-101-by-anthropic/",
      "snippet": "# Prompt Engineering 101 by Anthropic\n\nI came across the prompt engineering tips by the Anthropic team ðŸ‘‡\n\nI especially like the prompt structure tips\n\nHappy learning AI!\n\nI came across the prompt engineering tips by the Anthropic team ðŸ‘‡\n\nI especially like the prompt structure tips\n\nHappy learning AI!",
      "date": "2025-08-23",
      "last_updated": "2025-08-29"
    }
  ],
  "id": "3ff7e1c1-3f2d-4287-b448-b90f405c2c0e",
  "server_time": null
}
```

Make sure to that you create a new API key else you'll be facing the following error.
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "This endpoint requires a new API key. Create one at: https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/keys",
    "type": "api_key_created_before_search_api_cutoff",
    "code": 451
  }
}
```
