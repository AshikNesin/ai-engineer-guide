IDE like Windsurf, Trae, etc has this feature for quite sometime. But it's good support for this in cursor itself.

## Code Review UI
They've improved their code review UI.

## Sandbox Terminal
Agent commands runs in a sandbox (on macOS)

In macOS, it uses `sandbox-exec` (similar to how it is handled in Claude Code or Codex)

Shell commands that are not already in allow list will automatically run with **read/write access to your workspace and no internet access** 

They've seperate [doc](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal#sandboxing-beta) about it if you're curious about it.

## Composer - Their own AI model
Recently you might have noticed Cheetah model that was performing good enough but super fast.

This is the next iteration of that model.

## Parallel Agents
You can run a single prompt across 8 different AI model in parallel. 

This might be useful when you need more accuracy and ready to burn some money ðŸ¤‘

## Others
- Run Plan model with one model and build mode with another model.
- Improved prompt UI - They've removed explict context declaration like @Web, @Recent Changes, @Link, @Linter Errors, etc. And claim that agents can self-gather the context without needing to be explict.
- Sharable team commands
- Performance improvements ðŸ˜…
