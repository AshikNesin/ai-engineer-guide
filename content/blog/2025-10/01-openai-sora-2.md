OpenAI has recently released Sora 2.

It is really mind blowing ðŸ¤¯ 

Especially the video quality and sound. Much better than Google's Veo 3.

X is now filled with video generated with Sora 2. But in the long run there will a lot of AI slops because of it ðŸ™ˆ

Not only that, as the AI is getting better everyday. It is very hard to differentiate what is true and what is fake like this Sam Altman stealing GPU video

To be honest, this feels like the what OpenAI GPT-4 did for the coding use case but for videos
