When picking a model for a particular use case we need to have some kind of data points like what's the speed, cost, accuracy & how it does better than X model and things like that.

As you might have already known official benchmarks are kind of sketchy there days with manuplulating graph and things.

That's where indepedent AI benchmarking like [ArtificialAnalysis.ai](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) comes in.
