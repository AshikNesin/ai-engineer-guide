z.ai is currently offering black friday offer for their [GLM Coding Plan](https://go.nesin.io/glm). With it you can use latest GLM models like GLM 4.5 which performs as good as Sonnet 4 model. The best part is that you can use it with Claude Code and other various AI coding agents.

And it is pretty affordable.

Usually they offer 50% off for first term whether it is monthly/quaterly/yearly plan. But with black friday offer you get an extra 20-30% offer as well.

So it's the best time to get the subscription if you plan on getting it.
