Apparently HuggingFace has a AI powered website builder like bolt.new or Vercel's v0.

It is powered entirely by open models like DeepSeek, GLM-4.6, etc

Overall all it looks good enough and I was suprised that I didn't know about it before.

Here is a weather app that I've built using it.

As you can [see](https://ashiknesin-weathervista-dashboard.static.hf.space/index.html) it has the AI vibe but it's a good start.
