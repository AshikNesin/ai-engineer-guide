Google has launched their own version of [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.org/) which indexes the entire repo. This is really useful when you try to learn something new let's say a new framework.

And when it is supported for private repo, it'll be easy for someone to onboard to the a new team and helps in understanding the codebase pretty soon.

As on now:
- It looks like they've only selected open source repos, you can request a new repo but there is no guarantee that it'll be indexed unlike DeepWiki
- It has interactive docs & code
- And yeah, Gemini Chat agent that you can use to ask any questions

100% free right now but I think they might start charging for private repo or something.
