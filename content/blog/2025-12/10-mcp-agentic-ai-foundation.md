[Modal Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is now part of [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/) which is under **Linux Foundation**

The founding platinum members are as you can guess companies like Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, etc with projects like AGENTS.md, goose, etc donated by them.

## What's the change?
Anthropic claim that it'll be same.

> The Model Context Protocol’s governance model will remain unchanged: the project’s maintainers will continue to prioritize community input and transparent decision-making.
