It is interesting to know that Claude Code started as a **side project** by Boris Cherny (from Anthropic) which accounts for $1B in [annualized run-rate](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone) now.

> A year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one day.

100%, Not just Claude Code but everything is AI space is growing in a rapid phase and even legends like Andrej Karpathy feels left [behind](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521)
