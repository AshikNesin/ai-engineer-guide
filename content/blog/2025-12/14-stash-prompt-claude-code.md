When we have a very long prompt written in Claude code and suddenly need to run something else in it. 

You can leverage it's build-in stash feature for that.

Just press **Control + S** 

It'll stash your prompt, then once you run another thing, the previous prompt will come back.

Pretty nice feature. I usually copy-paste it in a scratchpad somewhere temp and then paste it again. 

This tiny feature is a good user experience and it'll be helpful for us!

Happy stashing prompts!
