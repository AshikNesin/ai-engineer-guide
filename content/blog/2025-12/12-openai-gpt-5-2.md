OpenAI has released their latest model family GPT 5.2

1LittleCoder has really quick walkthrough of the GPT 5.2 which you might useful to watch to get the gist of it instead of reading the benchmark and things.

Overall, this model seems to be powerful than the old model 5.1 and it is little pricier than 5.1 as well.
