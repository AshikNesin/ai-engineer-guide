Vercel has released [AI SDK 6](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-6)

The latest version of this SDK introduces new **agent abstractions**, better tool execution support covering the things that you need while building a production scale application like passing custom properties in `generate` or `stream`, approval flow, and much more 👇

Their DevTools seems interesting as well.

I'm not a fan of SDKs since this adds extra level of complexity when building a prod application but it is good to keep eye of what's happening with SDKs like that so that when you need to solve something then you can get inspiration from it.

Happy coding-with AI!
