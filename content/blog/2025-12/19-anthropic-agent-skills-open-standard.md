Similar to MCP, Anthropic has made Agent Skills as [open standard](https://agentskills.io).

[Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) are markdown based approach to control the AI agent behaviour and make it to perform things.

You can find the spec here: https://agentskills.io/specification

And it looks like Cursor, VS Code, etc has already started adopting it.
