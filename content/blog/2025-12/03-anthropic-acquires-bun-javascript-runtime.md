In an interesting turn on event, Anthropic has bought [Bun](https://bun.com) - JavaScript runtime that comes with batteries included like bundler, package manager, etc. 

Getting started with it is straightforward. Just one curl command and you are ready to use it.

One key thing that I really like about it is developer experience 😍

> We’re announcing that Anthropic is acquiring Bun—a breakthrough JavaScript runtime—to further accelerate Claude Code.

> "Bun represents exactly the kind of technical excellence we want to bring into Anthropic"

From their blog post it looks like an [acqui-hiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring) 

> Claude Code reached $1 billion in run-rate revenue in only 6 months

The blog post by Anthropic feels too much PR thing where they are talking about how great Claude Code is 😅

> Bun will remain open source and MIT-licensed, and we will continue to invest in making it the runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner of choice for JavaScript and TypeScript developers.

Good to know that it will remain MIT-licensed. At least for now.
