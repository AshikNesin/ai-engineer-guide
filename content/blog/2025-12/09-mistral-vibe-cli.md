Mistral team has released their agentic coding CLI like Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, etc

And it is open source (Apache 2.0 license) 😍

At the moment, the features are minimal like file selection but given enough time it might become good one like Open Code.

## How to get started?
```shell
curl -LsSf https://mistral.ai/vibe/install.sh | bash
```
