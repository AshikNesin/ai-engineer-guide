Ever wondered why your context gets filled so soon in your AI IDE or AI Agents? 
Chances are it could be because of the **prompts (tool definitions) for MCP** that you're using.

For example, if you're using [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file), it comes with these many tools by default. 

In your case you might not need all those things in the first place. Some of the tools' descriptions themselves could be so much.

Just imagine you have 10 different MCPs like this (they can fill up your context too soon)ðŸ˜…

**So what should you do instead?**

1. Just enable only the tools that you might need.

AI IDEs like Cursor and [Trae AI](https://x.com/Trae_ai/status/1967014989493145982) let you pick and choose the tools that you want in a MCP which you can use.

2. Avoid using multiple MCPs if you can.

Happy optimizing context!
