Lately, I've started using Zed for any quick edits, it has a fast vibe as Sublime Text and it consumes very less memory when compared with VS Code forks like Cursor.

And recently, they've started building lot of new AI features in it as well.

One iteresting thing about Zed is that you can actually bring any OpenAI compitable API. 

For example if you've GLM 4.5 coding plan you can just use it within Zed without paying extra for it.
