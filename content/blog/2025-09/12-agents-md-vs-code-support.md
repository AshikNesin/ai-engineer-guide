AI Agents generate better output when you have a set of rules that can be used by AI Agents every time you interact with them.

As of now, there is no official standard way to do it; each of them has their own way of doing things like CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, etc.

But lately, [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) is getting traction slowly, and the majority of AI Agents support that along with their proprietary file as well.

Recently, VS Code (v1.104+) started supporting that as well. 

With support for a common file for AI Agents, we can avoid creating multiple files for every single AI Agent.

Happy guiding agents!
