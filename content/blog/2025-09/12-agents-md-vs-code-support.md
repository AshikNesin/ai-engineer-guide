AI Agents have their own context file for example CLAUDE.md by Claude Code, GEMINI.md by Gemini CLI, etc.

You'll need to add those files in your project to get better output in from AI Agents.

There is a standard way to do it but [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is supported by most AI Agents

And VS Code v1.104+ will have support for that as well.
