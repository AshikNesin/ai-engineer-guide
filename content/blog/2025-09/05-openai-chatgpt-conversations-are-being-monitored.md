> “OpenAI is scanning users’ ChatGPT conversations and reporting content to the police.”

I came across this statement multiple times the last couple of days. Even mainstream news has articles about it.

Is it true?

Well, as per the privacy policy, it is true.

OpenAI runs **automated safety/moderation monitoring** and it flags any potentially harmful content which is reviewed by a human.

And if the human reviewer deems it necessary (like serious physical harm to others) then it is shared with law enforcement.

What's my take on this?
To be honest, it is both terrifying and needed in some cases.

If you're interacting with it, assume that it may be used against you.
