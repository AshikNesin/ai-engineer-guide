I recently came across the [talk](https://www.sanity.io/blog/first-attempt-will-be-95-garbage) by Vincent Quigley regarding how he uses Claude Code.

Here are my notes from his talk where he explains how he lets AI write the majority of his initial code (80%).

And why **treating AI like a junior dev who doesn't learn** has become his mental model these days.

## The Coding Pivots
In his career, he has had 4 major pivots in the way that he codes.

One interesting thing is that each transformation happened **faster** than the previous way of doing things.

## How he develops with AI
> I use AI mostly "to think with" as I'm working with it towards the code that ends up in production.

> Expecting perfection on attempt one is like expecting a junior developer to nail a complex feature without context.

## The Context Problem + Solution
AI can't retain the learning that it has done between sessions. We have to **manually** provide it.

And here is how he connects other tools with Claude Code

## PR Process

## Challenges

## Cost
Well, I'm seeing this pattern across multiple orgs. And yeah, Claude Code is quite expensive if you use usage-based billing.

It looks like he has 8% of the company spend on Claude Code ðŸ˜…

Background Agents could be a next way of doing things

## What does not work?
> AI doesn't learn from mistakes. You fix the same misunderstandings repeatedly. Your solution: **better documentation and more explicit instructions.**
> AI **confidently writes broken code** claiming that it's great. Always verify
> The context limit problem. Large codebases overwhelm AI context windows. Break problems into smaller chunks and provide focused context.

Happy building-with AI!
