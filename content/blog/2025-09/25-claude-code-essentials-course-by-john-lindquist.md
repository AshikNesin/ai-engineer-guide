I recently came across a free Claude Code course by John Lindquist from [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)

Like all other course on egghead, this course is also pretty small but packed with lot of useful information which you might find interesting if you plan on using Claude Code regularly.

And this is more of like a intro course so it is helpful if you're getting started with it.

Happy learning tools!
