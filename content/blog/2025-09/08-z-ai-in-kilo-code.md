Z.ai's [GLM-4.5](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) is pretty good open-source LLM which seems to perform similarly to proprietary AI models (almost).

I've recently started using their [Coding Plan](/blog/z-ai-glm-coding-plan/) as well, which you can use with Claude Code.

Let's see how to use the GLM-4.5 model in [Kilo Code](https://kilocode.ai/).

## Getting Started
- Head over to Kilo Code's settings.
- Create a new profile if needed.
- Then select "Z.ai" as the provider and enter the API key that you got from Z.ai's platform.

Happy coding-with AI!
