OpenAI's ChatGPT now has full support for MCP servers. You can connect any MCP server and use it as a tool in ChatGPT conversations.

This will be really helpful if you have custom use case for which you don't want to build a separate app and just use ChatGPT itself.

Here is the video by OpenAI Team on how to setup & use it 👇

KCD also has a really good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r8XW8Sz_gY) about it where he is using his blog's MCP to perform certain actions.
