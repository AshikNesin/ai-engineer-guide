Recently, we've talked about Z.ai's [GLM-4.5](/blog/claude-code-z-ai-glm-4-5/) which was performing as good as Anthropic's Sonnet 4 for coding.

And you can use it in Claude Code.

It seems they've recently launched a subscription plan using which you can save lot of cost and best thing is you can use it in Claude Code.

You can get started with their $3/mo plan or you can go with $15/mo plan.
