Anthropic has recently Claude Sonnet 4.5 which is a successor to Sonnet 4.

Generally, Sonnet models are really good one (and little cheaper than Opus model) and I prefer to use it over other models in day to day works.

In terms of pricing, it is $3 for input and $15 for output tokens (same as Sonnet 4)

You can use this over api by passing `claude-sonnet-4-5` as model name.

Here is the comparison. As you can see apart quality output as they've claimed in their release post there is no other major update from Sonnet 4 model.
