OpenAI finally has support for domain-level filtering in their [web search tool](/blog/openai-web-search-tool/)

You need to pass in `filters.allowed_domains` when defining the tools

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.openai.com/v1/responses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "web_search",
            "filters": {
                "allowed_domains": [
                    "aiengineerguide.com"
                ]
            }
        }
    ],
    "tool_choice": "auto",
    "include": [
        "web_search_call.action.sources"
    ],
    "input": "Does OpenAI supports web hooks?"
}'
```

After setting it up, you’ll receive a **signing secret** used to verify that incoming webhook requests genuinely originate from OpenAI ([aiengineerguide.com](https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/openai-webhooks/?utm_source=openai)).\n\n- Supported event types include:\n  - Batches: `batch.completed`, `batch.failed`, `batch.expired`, `batch.cancelled`\n  - Background responses: `response.completed`, `response.failed`, `response.cancelled`, `response.incomplete`\n  - Fine-tuning jobs: `fine_tuning.job.succeeded`, `fine_tuning.job.failed`, `fine_tuning.job.cancelled`\n  - Eval runs: `eval.run.succeeded`, `eval.run.failed`, `eval.run.canceled` ([aiengineerguide.com](https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/openai-webhooks/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- The webhook payload includes headers like `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, and `webhook-signature`, alongside a JSON body with event details. You must respond with a **2xx HTTP status code** quickly to acknowledge receipt, otherwise OpenAI will retry delivery with exponential backoff (for up to 72 hours) ([aiengineerguide.com](https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/openai-webhooks/?utm_source=openai)).\n\n- To verify webhook signatures, you can use the OpenAI SDK or standard webhook libraries. The SDK provides a method like:\n  \n  ```js\n  const event = client.webhooks.unwrap(req.body, req.headers, { secret: webhook_secret });\n  ```\n  \n  —which will throw or raise an error if the signature is invalid ([aiengineerguide.com](https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/openai-webhooks/?utm_source=openai)).\n\n---\n\n**In summary**:\nYes—OpenAI supports webhooks, allowing you to receive real-time notifications for events such as background response completion, batch job status updates, fine-tuning progress, and evaluation results. Webhooks are project-specific, secure via signing secrets, require quick 2xx acknowledgments, and are supported via their SDK for easy signature validation—according to aiengineerguide.com ([aiengineerguide.com](https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/openai-webhooks/?utm_source=openai)).\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper dive into implementation examples or best practices!"

This feature is really helpful for those who are building some sort of Q&A bot based on public content like blogs or websites. Instead of building a RAG pipeline ourselves, we can just get the data on demand.

But beware of the cost if you need this feature at scale.
