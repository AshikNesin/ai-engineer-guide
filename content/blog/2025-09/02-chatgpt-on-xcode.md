Latest versions of Xcode (like 26+) have a new [intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/writing-code-with-intelligence-in-xcode) feature which lets you code much more efficiently on Xcode. 

Think of it like GitHub Copilot but that is baked into Xcode as a feature instead of installing an external plugin.

It lets you use the ChatGPT subscription directly with it. So you don't need to pay separately for the API usage.

You can also use the OpenAI Chat Completion compatible API if you prefer.

## How to get started?
1. In Xcode, go to **Xcode > Settings**
2. Select **Intelligence** in the sidebar.
3. Turn on **ChatGPT** as your model.

Once you're done you should be able to use it in Xcode editor
