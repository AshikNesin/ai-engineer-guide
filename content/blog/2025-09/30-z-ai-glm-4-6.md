Another day, another LLM ðŸ˜…

Just a day after Anthropic's Sonnet 4.5 release, Z.AI has released there open source LLM - GLM 4.6 and based on the benchmarks it is as good as Sonnet 4.

And it is a decent model to be honest. I've tried for my side projects.

The major upgrade from previous version are:
- **Larger Context Window** - From 128K to 200K tokens
- And the improvement in **reasoning performance** and **tool use** which leads to better performance overall.

For those who prefers benchmarks ðŸ‘‡
