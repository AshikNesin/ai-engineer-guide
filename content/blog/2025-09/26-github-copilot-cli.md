Another day, another agentic cli ðŸ˜…

GitHub Copilot has released their coding agent like Claude Code in public beta.

ðŸ‘‰ https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-25-github-copilot-cli-is-now-in-public-preview/

Right now, it is pretty basic version though don't expect much from it though and it has the usual stuffs like MCP

## How to get started?
You can install this from npm

```shell
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

Once you've installed it, login with your GitHub account.

And start using it like how you use Claude Code or other agentic CLI.

## Heads up!
It comes with GitHub MCP by default (and currently you can't disable it ðŸ™ˆ) - So it just eats away your available context forcefully.
