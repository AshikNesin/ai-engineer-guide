GitHub has recently launched their official marketplace for MCP.

ðŸ‘‰ [MCP Registry Â· GitHub](https://github.com/mcp)

Right now, it only has handful of MCP servers listed there but it is still in early stage.

VS Code might have first class support for installing MCP powered by this marketplace.
