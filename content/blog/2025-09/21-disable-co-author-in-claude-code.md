By default, if you commit code using Claude Code, then it adds **co-authored-by Claude** in those commits.

If you prefer not to have those in attributions, you can just disable it using `settings.json`

In MacOS/Linux, you can find it at `~/.claude/settings.json`

There, set **includeCoAuthoredBy** to false like this

That's pretty much it.
