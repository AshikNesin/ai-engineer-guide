Ollama Cloud has now web search API which we can use to perform real time search. This is similar what Perplexity Search, Brave search, Exa.ai provides.

In their docs, they've claimed that they provide higher rate limit (but I'm not sure about the exact number though)

> Ollama provides a generous free tier of web searches for individuals to use, and higher rate limits are available via Ollamaâ€™s cloud.

Search API helps the LLM to get recent data which helps to generate more accurate response (and less hallucination)

## How to get started?
Create a Ollama [cloud account](https://ollama.com/cloud) and get [API](https://ollama.com/settings/keys) key from it.

And then you can just use it by invoking this API endpoint like this
