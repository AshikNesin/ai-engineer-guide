We can now perform real-time search using Perplexity Search API similar to how [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai) or [Brave search](https://brave.com/search/api/) works.

If you have Perplexity Pro then you get [$5/mo](/blog/free-llm-credits-for-perplexity-pro/) credits which you can use it for this API as well.

## How to get started?
First thing, you need to get a [new API key](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/keys) - If you have old API key then it does not work with search API, so make sure to create a new one.

```shell
curl --location 'https://api.perplexity.ai/search' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "query": [
      "latest simonwillison posts"
    ]
  }'
  ```

            "snippet": "*Disclosure: I got a preview of this at an event at Microsoft's offices in Seattle last week. They did not pay me for my time but they did cover my flight, hotel and some dinners.*\n\n**Improved Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite**\n\n(via)\n\nTwo new preview models from Google - updates to their fast and inexpensive Flash and Flash Lite families:\n\nThe latest version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite was trained and built based on three key themes:\n\n\n\nBetter instruction following: The model is significantly better at following complex instructions and system prompts.\n\n\n\nReduced verbosity: It now produces more concise answers, a key factor in reducing token costs and latency for high-throughput applications (see charts above).\n\n\n\nStronger multimodal & translation capabilities: This update features more accurate audio transcription, better image understanding, and improved translation quality.\n\n[...]\n\nThis latest 2.5 Flash model comes with improvements in two key areas we heard consistent feedback on:\n\n\n\nBetter agentic tool use: We've improved how the model uses tools, leading to better performance in more complex, agentic and multi-step applications. This model shows noticeable improvements on key agentic benchmarks, including a 5% gain on SWE-Bench Verified, compared to our last release (48.9% → 54%).... **gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025-thinking**\n\nA minimalist stick figure graphic depicts a person with a white oval body and a dot head cycling a gray bicycle, carrying a large, bright yellow rectangular box resting high on their back.\n\n**gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025**\n\nA simple cartoon drawing of a pelican riding a bicycle, with the text \"A Pelican Riding a Bicycle\" above it.\n\n**gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025-thinking**\n\nA quirky, simplified cartoon illustration of a white bird with a round body, black eye, and bright yellow beak, sitting astride a dark gray, two-wheeled vehicle with its peach-colored feet dangling below.\n\n**gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025**\n\nA minimalist, side-profile illustration of a stylized yellow chick or bird character riding a dark-wheeled vehicle on a green strip against a white background.\n\nArtificial Analysis posted a detailed review, including these interesting notes about reasoning efficiency and speed:\n\n- In reasoning mode, Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite Preview 09-2025 are more token-efficient, using fewer output tokens than their predecessors to run the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite Preview 09-2025 uses 50% fewer output tokens than its predecessor, while Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 09-2025 uses 24% fewer output tokens.\n\n- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite Preview 09-2025 (Reasoning) is ~40% faster than the prior July release, delivering ~887 output tokens/s on Google AI Studio in our API endpoint performance benchmarking. This makes the new Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite the fastest proprietary model we have benchmarked on the Artificial Analysis website... If you hide the system prompt and tool descriptions for your LLM agent, what you're actually doing is deliberately hiding the most useful documentation describing your service from your most sophisticated users!... **Qwen3-VL: Sharper Vision, Deeper Thought, Broader Action**\n\n(via)\n\nI've been looking forward to this. Qwen 2.5 VL is one of the best available open weight vision LLMs, so I had high hopes for Qwen 3's vision models.\n\nFirstly, we are open-sourcing the flagship model of this series: Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B, available in both Instruct and Thinking versions. The Instruct version matches or even exceeds Gemini 2.5 Pro in major visual perception benchmarks. The Thinking version achieves state-of-the-art results across many multimodal reasoning benchmarks.\n\nBold claims against Gemini 2.5 Pro, which are supported by a flurry of self-reported benchmarks.\n\nThis initial model is\n\n*enormous*. On Hugging Face both Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct and Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking are 235B parameters and weigh 471 GB. Not something I'm going to be able to run on my 64GB Mac!\n\nThe Qwen 2.5 VL family included models at 72B, 32B, 7B and 3B sizes. Given the rate Qwen are shipping models at the moment I wouldn't be surprised to see smaller Qwen 3 VL models show up in just the next few days.... Also from Qwen today, three new API-only closed-weight models: upgraded Qwen 3 Coder, Qwen3-LiveTranslate-Flash (real-time multimodal interpretation), and Qwen3-Max, their new trillion parameter flagship model, which they describe as their \"largest and most capable model to date\".\n\nPlus Qwen3Guard, a \"safety moderation model series\" that looks similar in purpose to Meta's Llama Guard. This one is open weights (Apache 2.0) and comes in 8B, 4B and 0.6B sizes on Hugging Face. There's more information in the QwenLM/Qwen3Guard GitHub repo.\n\n**Why AI systems might never be secure**.\n\nThe Economist have a new piece out about LLM security, with this headline and subtitle:\n\nWhy AI systems might never be secure\n\nA “lethal trifecta” of conditions opens them to abuse\n\nI talked with their AI Writer Alex Hern for this piece.\n\nThe gullibility of LLMs had been spotted before ChatGPT was even made public. In the summer of 2022, Mr Willison and others independently coined the term “prompt injection” to describe the behaviour, and real-world examples soon followed. In January 2024, for example, DPD, a logistics firm, chose to turn off its AI customer-service bot after customers realised it would follow their commands to reply with foul language.... That abuse was annoying rather than costly. But Mr Willison reckons it is only a matter of time before something expensive happens. As he puts it, “we’ve not yet had millions of dollars stolen because of this”. It may not be until such a heist occurs, he worries, that people start taking the risk seriously. The industry does not, however, seem to have got the message. Rather than locking down their systems in response to such examples, it is doing the opposite, by rolling out powerful new tools with the lethal trifecta built in from the start.\n\nThis is the clearest explanation yet I've seen of these problems in a mainstream publication. Fingers crossed relevant people with decision-making authority finally start taking this seriously!... *is*open weights, as Apache 2.0 Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct, Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner on HuggingFace. That Instruct model is 70.5GB so this should be relatively accessible for running on expensive home devices.\n\n- Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is an updated version of their excellent Qwen-Image-Edit model which I first tried last month. Their blog post calls it \"the monthly iteration of Qwen-Image-Edit\" so I guess they're planning more frequent updates. The new model adds multi-image inputs. I used it via chat.qwen.ai to turn a photo of our dog into a dragon in the style of one of Natalie's ceramic pots.\n\nHere's the prompt I used, feeding in two separate images. Weirdly it used the edges of the landscape photo to fill in the gaps on the otherwise portrait output. It turned the chair seat into a bowl too!\n\n**CompileBench: Can AI Compile 22-year-old Code?**\n\n(via)\n\nInteresting new LLM benchmark from Piotr Grabowski and Piotr Migdał: how well can different models handle compilation challenges such as cross-compiling... Mistral quietly released two new models yesterday: Magistral Small 1.2 (Apache 2.0, 96.1 GB on Hugging Face) and Magistral Medium 1.2 (not open weights same as Mistral's other \"medium\" models.)\n\nDespite being described as \"minor updates\" to the Magistral 1.1 models these have one very notable improvement:\n\n- Multimodality: Now equipped with a vision encoder, these models handle both text and images seamlessly.\n\nMagistral is Mistral's reasoning model, so we now have a new reasoning vision LLM.\n\nThe other features from the tiny announcement on Twitter:\n\n- Performance Boost: 15% improvements on math and coding benchmarks such as AIME 24/25 and LiveCodeBench v5/v6.\n\n- Smarter Tool Use: Better tool usage with web search, code interpreter, and image generation.\n\n- Better Tone & Persona: Responses are clearer, more natural, and better formatted for you.\n\n**The Hidden Risk in Notion 3.0 AI Agents: Web Search Tool Abuse for Data Exfiltration**.\n\nAbi Raghuram reports that Notion 3.0, released yesterday, introduces new prompt injection data exfiltration vulnerabilities thanks to enabling lethal trifecta attacks.... ### Sept. 16, 2025\n\n**Announcing the 2025 PSF Board Election Results!**\n\nI'm happy to share that I've been re-elected for second term on the board of directors of the Python Software Foundation.\n\nJannis Leidel was also re-elected and Abigail Dogbe and Sheena O’Connell will be joining the board for the first time.",

He shares which models work best for writing Python versus JavaScript and compares coding tools and environments.\n\nWe discuss prompt engineering techniques and the first steps to take. Simon shares his enthusiasm for the usefulness of LLMs but cautions about the potential pitfalls.\n\nSimon also shares how he got involved in open-source development and Django. He's a proponent of starting a blog and shares how it opened doors for his career. \n\nThis episode is sponsored by Postman.\n\nTopics:... - 00:00:00 -- Introduction\n- 00:02:38 -- How did you get involved in open source?\n- 00:04:04 -- Writing an XML-RPC library\n- 00:04:40 -- Working on Django in Lawrence, Kansas\n- 00:05:31 -- Started building open-source collection\n- 00:06:52 -- shot-scraper: taking automated screenshots of websites\n- 00:08:09 -- First experiences with LLMs\n- 00:10:08 -- 22 years of simonwillison.net\n- 00:18:22 -- Navigating the hype and criticism of LLMs\n- 00:22:14 -- Where to start with Python code and LLMs?\n- 00:26:22 -- Sponsor: Postman\n- 00:27:13 -- ChatGPT Canvas vs Code Interpreter\n- 00:28:23 -- Asking nicely, tricking the system, and tipping?\n- 00:30:35 -- More Code Interpreter and building a C extension\n- 00:32:05 -- More details on Canvas \n- 00:36:55 -- What is a workflow for developing using LLMs?... - 00:39:43 -- Creating pieces of code vs a system\n- 00:42:00 -- Workout program for prompting and pitfalls\n- 00:53:54 -- Video Course Spotlight\n- 00:55:14 -- Why an SVG of a  pelican riding a bicycle?\n- 00:57:48 -- Repeating a query and refining\n- 01:03:00 -- Working in an IDE or text editor\n- 01:05:45 -- David Crawshaw on writing code with LLMs \n- 01:08:33 -- Running an LLM locally to write code \n- 01:14:02 -- Staying out of the AGI conversation\n- 01:16:07 -- What are you excited about in the world of Python?\n- 01:18:34 -- What do you want to learn next?\n- 01:19:53 -- How can people follow your work online?\n- 01:20:51 -- Thanks and goodbye\n\n👉 Links from the show: https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/236/... {ts:0} welcome to the real python podcast this is episode 236 what are the large language model tools you can use to develop python what\n{ts:11} prompting techniques and strategies produce better results this week on the show we speak with Simon Willison about his llm research and exploring writing python code with these rapidly changing tools Simon's been researching llms over the past 2 and a half years and documenting the results on blog he\n{ts:31} shares Which models work best for writing python versus JavaScript and Compares coding tools and environments we discuss prompt engineering techniques and the first steps to take Simon shares his enthusiasm for the usefulness of llms but cautions about the potential pitfalls he also shares how he got\n{ts:50} involved in open source development and Jango he's a proponent of starting a blog and shares how it opened doors for his career this episode is sponsored by Postman Postman is the world's leading API collaboration platform and they just launched Postman AI agent Builder the\n{ts:71} quickest way to build AI agents start building at post man.com SLP podcast python all right let's get started [Music] the real python podcast is a weekly conversation about using python in the real world my name is Christopher Bailey... {ts:106} your host each week we feature interviews with experts in the community and discussions about the topics articles and courses found at real python. after the podcast join us and learn real world python skills with a community of experts at real python. comom hey Simon welcome to the show hey\n{ts:124} it's really exciting to be here yeah I'm stoked to talk to you uh I've been mentioning that I've been wanting to get you on the show for a while and we definitely have referenced a bunch of stuff that you've written about throughout the last few years and you're sort of diving into the world of llms and this sort of research and stuff that you do I I can't tear myself away from\n{ts:143} it it's all far too interesting and weird it's like yeah yeah no other area of computer science I've ever dealt with before okay so that's uh maybe part of what we'll dig into is like the sort of fascination of like why why did you get into this and stuff like that what I'd like to start with and I've done this with a handful of people recently is not\n{ts:162} go so far back into like well how'd you get into computer programming but more how did you get involved in open source because you do a lot of Open Source projects in fact I I featured one of your projects recently the shot scraper which I think is a really awesome tool on the show recently and I just feel like you are able to get people people... 's the simplest like little command online ra I can put around this lightwe that does all of the work and I built that yeah and that's a trick I use a lot like the secret to my productivity is I'm really good at spotting opportunities where it's like oh for a 100 lines of code I will get a\n{ts:461} significant win so I can knock out that 100 lines of code because I happen to know Python and click and GitHub actions and all of these little bits and pieces and I can find new ways to combine them that build something good so you can see the investment return on investment kind\n{ts:477} of thing pretty easily in your head now after doing 800 projects yeah and then you you just pick the easiest ones you're like okay that for the amount of work I put in I will get a really cool thing out the other end that's worth doing so I don't know exactly when you started to dive into llm stuff was it just right as they started to emerge were you working with early ones back in\n{ts:498} four five six years ago so my very first experiment was with with gpt2 back in 2019 I tried a project I got it to generate New York Times headlines for different decades the idea was that you sort of Feed in a bunch of New York... 're like start searching for something that and then find the result oh I wrote about that clearly that happens to be so much honestly I've got like I said I've got\n{ts:940} 850 projects which means that sometimes I will forget a project exists and I will go looking for a solution something there will be a library that I wrote that I had fallen out of my head that's that's deeply entertaining when that happens yeah yeah do you think it's easier than ever to start a blog well I don't know like one of the things\n{ts:959} I haven't quite got my head around is I keep on hearing rumors that Google doesn't credit new sites nearly as much as it used to but like but these like it's SEO there were rumors about everything so it might be that because my blog has existed effectively for 20 years I've got so much sort of built up like credibility with Google that I get\n{ts:978} yeah credentials I get results and I if that is the case I'd say start your blog now and in 10 years time yeah yeah you know that that that investment starts paying off in terms of the the search ranking although who knows what search will look like in three years time at this point you know yeah I feel like the benefits that you outlined already are there too though the the idea that it... ve got our own ways around this now and the other thing I think that's\n{ts:1054} really important I keep on focusing on the idea of credibility like building credibility is so important like when I'm looking for sources of information I look for people who have earned credibility with me and I want to earn credibility myself with other people and having like 20 years of blog content gives you instant credibility like I can\n{ts:1072} point you to my sqlite tag on my blog which goes back to 2003 when I first heard about sqlite you know right yeah and that so I love that I feel like and that's the kind of thing where credibility is accumulated over time and it doesn't take much like a link blog about a subject run that for six months and you will become one of the top .1%\n{ts:1092} people on Earth for credibility on that subject just from publishing a few notes and linking to a bunch of things about it yeah got to start that's the trick yeah as you started this process of writing about and researching llms I guess maybe we can we can cover some one\n{ts:1109} of these things that you've written about recently at least on social media how people have been saying oh you're a shill about llm which I think is really kind of fascinating because in a way there",

This audio is the original post. This is for learning purpose only. Copyright belongs to Simon Willison. \n\n\nUsing LLMs to write code is difficult and unintuitive. It takes significant effort to figure out the sharp and soft edges of using them in this way, and there’s precious little guidance to help people figure out how best to apply them.... {ts:0} from Simon Willis's blog at Simon willis. net posted 11th March 2025 at\n{ts:5} 209 p.m. here's how I use llms to help me write code online discussions about using\n{ts:12} large language models to help write code inevitably produce comments from developers whose experiences have been\n{ts:19} disappointing they often ask what they're doing wrong how come some people are reporting such great results when\n{ts:25} their own experiments have proved lacking using llms to write code is difficult and\n{ts:32} unintuitive it takes significant effort to figure out the sharp and soft edges of using them in this way and there's\n{ts:39} precious little guidance to help people figure out how best to apply them if someone tells you that coding with llms\n{ts:46} is easy they are probably unintentionally misleading you they may well have stumbled onto patterns that\n{ts:52} work but those patterns do not come naturally to everyone I've been getting great results out of llms for code for\n{ts:59} over 2 years now here's my attempt at transferring some of that experience and intuition to you set reasonable\n{ts:66} expectations account for training cuto off dates context is King ask them for options tell them exactly what to do you... {ts:216} major breaking change since October 2023 open AI models won't know about it I gain enough value from llms that I now\n{ts:225} deliberately consider this when picking a library I try to stick with libraries with good stability and that are popular\n{ts:232} enough that many examples of them will have made it into the training data I like applying the principles of\n{ts:238} boring technology innovate on your Project's unique selling points stick with tried and\n{ts:244} tested solutions for everything else llms can still help you work with libraries that exist outside their\n{ts:251} training data but you need to put in more work you'll need to feed them recent examples of how those libraries\n{ts:258} should be used as part of your prompt this brings us to the most important thing to understand when\n{ts:264} working with llms context is King most of the craft of getting good results out of an llm comes down to managing its\n{ts:273} context the text that is part of your current conversation this context isn't just the prompt that you have fed it\n{ts:280} successful llm interactions usually take the form of conversations and the context consists of every message from...

            "snippet": "I’m writing about this today because it’s been one of my “can LLMs do this reliably yet?” questions for over two years now. I think they’ve just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without feeling the need to check everything they say with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nI still don’t trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust them enough that I’ll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.\n\nThis also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we’ve been predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly from the chatbot instead?\n\nThe lawsuits over this started flying back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are a lot higher now that they’re actually good at it!\n\nI can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.\n\nI keep thinking of the quote that “information wants to be free”.\n\nAs the capabilities of open-source LLMs continue to increase, I keep finding myself wanting a locally-running model at arms length any time I’m near a computer.\n\nHow many more cool things can I accomplish with computers if I can always have a “good enough” answer at my disposal for virtually any question for free?",
