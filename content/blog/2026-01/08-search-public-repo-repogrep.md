Aiden Bai has recently released [repogrep](https://app.ami.dev/repogrep) using which you can quickly search anything in a public repo. 

Unlike grep.app or other similar too where you can search code, here you can chat with it as well.

And it pretty fast ⚡ (Thanks to Cerebras)

Like the name suggest, the way it works is it clone the public repo in a sandbox and then runs grep on it to gather context like how Claude Code and other tools does.

With that context, it answers our questions.
