OpenCode now has first class support for connecting your ChatGPT subscription so use OpenAI models like GPT-5.2 Codex, GPT-5.2, etc without having to pay seperately for usage.

All you need to is just make sure that you're on latest version of OpenCode - v1.1.11+

And then connect OpenAI by running the following command

```shell
opencode auth login
```

Once it is successfully authenticated, you'll be able to use those models (`/models` command)
