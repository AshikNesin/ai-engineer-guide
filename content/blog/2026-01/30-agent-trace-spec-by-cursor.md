Cursor team has published `RFC` for Agent Trace an open specification.

It is primirly used for tracking **AI-generated code**.

The main advantage that they claim is that it is `vendor-neutral` format.

> As agents write more code, it's important to understand what came from AI versus humans. This attribution is both the models used as well as the related agent conversations. Agent Trace defines an open, interoperable standard for recording this attribution data.
