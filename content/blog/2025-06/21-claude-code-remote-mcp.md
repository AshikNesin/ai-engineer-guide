By now, almost everyone who is using AI for code generation should be aware of [**Claude Code** ](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)— an awesome CLI-based agentic code generation tool.

I’ve tried it a couple of times recently and I’m really impressed with the results 🙌

**[Remote MCP](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/remote-mcp-servers) is now supported.**

Which means you can now integrate your tools easily with Claude Code.

Just imagine — you say a query like _"Fix bug-x"_, and it fetches the bug details from Sentry (or your bug reporting app) and addresses it.

How cool is that? 🤯
