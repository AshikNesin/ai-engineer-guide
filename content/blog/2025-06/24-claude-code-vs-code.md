Anthropic has recently launched VS Code extention for Claude Code

While interacting with Claude Code in terminal, this extension acts as a compliment to Claude Code.

At the moment, it has support for the following:
- **Selection context**: Selected text in the editor is automatically added to Claude’s context
- **Diff viewing**: Code changes can be displayed directly in VSCode’s diff viewer instead of the terminal
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Support for shortcuts like Alt+Cmd+K to push selected code into Claude’s prompt
- Tab awareness: Claude can see which files you have open in the editor
- Configuration: Set diff tool to auto in /config to enable IDE integration features
