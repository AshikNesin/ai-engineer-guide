There are so many LLM pricing calculators out there.

However, most are designed to upsell their products or require too much configuration to get pricing for your usage.

But [llm-pricing.com](https://www.llm-prices.com) by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net)  is a pretty good one.

On the right side, you can see a pricing table, and on the left, you can enter tokens to calculate the price.

No ads. No upselling. No complicated inputs.

Just a simple UI that does the job really well 👇
