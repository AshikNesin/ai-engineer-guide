If you want to understand how AI agents like [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) under the hood, probably their codebase might feel too overwhelming with so many modules and things.

Chao Huang has built [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) which has similar architecture. But the core functionalities are built with less than **~4,000 lines of code**.

You can use something like [OpenWiki](https://deepwiki.com/HKUDS/nanobot) to quickly understand how it works behind the scenes.
