Bhanu from SiteGPT.ai has written a detailed article on X on how he uses OpenClaw for his business.

He has essentially has built a mission control for his business (which was built by OpenClaw agent)

And he has created multiple agents with specific roles.

All of work together to build help him make more money from his business.

The agents has different roles: content writer, seo analyst, designer, developer, etc

They even have daily standup. It is kind of like a mini startup that works 24x7 to achieve his goal.
