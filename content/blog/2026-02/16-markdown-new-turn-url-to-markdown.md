With [markdown.new](https://markdown.new), we can easily turn any URL into markdown content.

Under the hood, it is powered by Cloudflare workers.

## How to use it?

Just append `https://markdown.new/` before any url.

Like this:

`https://markdown.new/https://aiengineerguide.com/blog/glm-5-in-pi-coding-agent/` 

And you should be seeing a clean markdown for that url.

The best thing is, it is free to use. No sign up, no api keys and things like that. (So be cautious before using it for anything critical)
