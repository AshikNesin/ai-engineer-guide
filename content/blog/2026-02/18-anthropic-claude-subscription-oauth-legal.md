Many apps like OpenClaw, OpenCode, etc had a feature using which you can use the existing subscription from Anthropic and not needing pay per usage.

It was kind of gray area until now. But they've recently updated the legal docs saying that using Claude subscription for other than Claude Code is not allowed anymore (officially)

>OAuth authentication (used with Free, Pro, and Max plans) is intended exclusively for Claude Code and Claude.ai. Using OAuth tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product, tool, or service — including the Agent SDK — is not permitted and constitutes a violation of the Consumer Terms of Service.

Their intention might purely from business standpoint but it is making negative impression on them when companies like OpenAI are okay with it (at least for now)
