Claude Code now supports resuming sessions that are linked to a GitHub pull request with their new flag `--from-pr`

This is really useful for something that you've worked couple of days ago and need continue in that same session to address code review or make any changes related to it.

Currently, it support resume by specifying:

- PR number
- PR URL
- Selecting interactively from the list
