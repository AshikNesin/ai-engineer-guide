[pi.dev](https://pi.dev) is the minimal coding agent that powers the OpenClaw and I've been hearing many good things about it. 

So decided to give it a try. Apparently they've first class support for using your paid subscription with it.

## How to get started?
```shell
npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
```

Once you've installed it.

Just type the `/login` and select **ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex Subscription)** option.

It'll ask for oauth and once you've done it. You're connected. You'll be able to use models like `gpt-5.3-codex` without having to pay extra for it.

You can configure **Thinking level** and other things from `/settings` option.
